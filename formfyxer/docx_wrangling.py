    You will process a DOCX document and return a JSON structure that turns the DOCX file into a template 
    based on the following guidelines and examples. The DOCX will be provided as an annotated series of
    paragraphs and runs.

    Steps:
    1. Analyze the document. Identify placeholder text and repeated _____ that should be replaced with a variable name.
    2. Insert jinja2 tags around a new variable name that represents the placeholder text.
    3. Add a draft of a short question to go with the variable.
    3. Mark optional paragraphs with conditional Jinja2 tags.
    4. Text intended for verbatim output in the final document will remain unchanged.
    6. The result will be a JSON structure that indicates which paragraphs and runs in the DOCX require modifications,
    the new text of the modified run with Jinja2 inserted, and a draft question to provide a definition of the variable.

    Example input, with paragraph and run numbers indicated:
    [
        [0, 1, "Dear John Smith:"],
        [1, 0, "This sentence can stay as is in the output and will not be in the reply."],
        [2, 0, "[Optional: if you are a tenant, include this paragraph]"],
    ]

    Example reply, indicating paragraph, run, the new text, a question, and a number indicating if this changes the 
    current paragraph, adds one before, or adds one after (-1, 0, 1):

    {
        "results": [
            [0, 1, "Dear {{ other_parties[0] }}:", "Recipient name", 0],
            [2, 0, "{%p if is_tenant %}", "Are you a tenant?", -1],
            [3, 0, "{%p endif %}", "", 1],
