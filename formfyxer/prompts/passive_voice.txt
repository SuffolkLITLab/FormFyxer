Identify passive voice verb phrases in the sentence and output JSON only.

Output schema (already enforced separately):
{
	"results": [
		{ "sentence": "<original sentence>", "fragments": ["passive verb phrase", ...] }
	]
}

Every input sentence must appear exactly once in `results` with its original text and a `fragments` array (use `[]` when no passive fragment exists). If uncertain whether a construction is passive, prefer returning an empty `fragments` array rather than guessing.

Definition (for this task): PASSIVE VOICE = auxiliary "be" (or being / been) + past participle where the subject undergoes the action. Include progressive + passive stacks (e.g. "is being repaired").

Extract the shortest verb phrase span that signals the passive (include all auxiliaries belonging to it):
Patterns to capture (examples → fragments):
1. be + VBN: "was thrown" → "was thrown"
2. be + adverb? + VBN: "was quickly approved" → "was quickly approved"
3. be + being + VBN: "is being discussed" → "is being discussed"
4. be + been + VBN: "has been chosen" → "has been chosen"
5. get + VBN (causative passive) ONLY if not an idiom: "got hired" → "got hired"

Do NOT mark:
- be + adjective/state: "is open", "was happy", "is ready"
- progressive active: "was running", "is working"
- copular + noun: "was president"
- perfect active: "has eaten" (transitive active, no passive morphology)

Edge guidance:
- If an agent phrase ("by X") appears after a valid passive, still mark the passive verb phrase only (do not include "by").
- Allow intervening adverbs inside the phrase ("was carefully crafted").
- Multiple passives in one sentence => list each fragment separately.

Return only JSON per schema. If no passive, fragments = [].

Example:
Input sentences:
1. The ball was thrown by John.

Expected JSON:
{"results": [{"sentence": "The ball was thrown by John.", "fragments": ["was thrown"]}]}

Another example (active voice):
Input sentences:
1. John threw the ball.

Expected JSON:
{"results": [{"sentence": "John threw the ball.", "fragments": []}]}
